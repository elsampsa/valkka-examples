    # backend has been given the index i
    # does the blocking operation, and after that call this:
    self.eg.set(i)

class EventFdGroup:

    You should instantiate an object from this class before spawning any
    multiprocesses: this way the sync primitives are visible to all of them.
    A global "singleton" module is a good way to do this (see demo_singleton.py)

    The list if EventFds (self.events) stays constant accross multiprocesses.

    Main process (aka frontend) reserves EventFds from this list and communicates
    the list index to the multiprocess (aka backend) which then knows which EventFd
    to pick up from the list.

    Why like this?

    Because we can't send an EventFd object through the intercom pipe between the multiprocessing
    back- and frontend.  So we just send an index number.

    To summarize:

    - EventFd's are created before forking (so they're visible for everyone)
    - After fork, only list indices are communicated between the main process and 
    the multiprocess
