Installing
==========

Install valkka-core
-------------------

For recent ubuntu distributions, the core library binary packages and python bindings are provided by a PPA repository.  Subscribe to the PPA repo (do this only once) with:

::

  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:sampsa-riikonen/valkka
  
Install with:

::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install valkka
  
When you need to update valkka, do:
  
::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade valkka
    
If you're not using a recent Ubuntu distro and need to build libValkka and it's python bindings yourself, please refer to the `valkka-core github page <https://github.com/elsampsa/valkka-core>`_.

The debian package includes the core library, its python bindings and some API level 2 python code.  The python part is installed "globally" into */usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/*


Numpy
-----

Valkka-core binaries has been compiled with the numpy version that comes with the corresponding Ubuntu distro, i.e. the numpy you would install with ```sudo apt-get install python3-numpy```.

That version is automatically installed when you install valkka core with ```sudo apt-get```, but it might be "shadowed" by your *locally* installed numpy.

If you get errors about numpy import, try removing your locally installed numpy (i.e. the version you installed with ```pip install --user```).


Install the testsuite
---------------------

First, install some debian packages:

::

  sudo apt-get install python3-pip git mesa-utils ffmpeg vlc

some of these will be used for benchmarking Valkka agains other programs.

The testsuite and tutorials use also imutils and PyQt5, so install a fresh version of them locally with pip:

::

  pip3 install --user imutils PyQt5 PySide2 setproctitle
  
Here we have installed two flavors of the Qt python bindings, namely, `PyQt5 <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com>`_ and `PySide2 <https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/contents.html>`_.  They can be used in an identical manner.  If you use PyQt5, be aware of its licensing terms.

Finally, for tutorial code and the PyQt test suite, download **valkka-examples** with:

::

    git clone https://github.com/elsampsa/valkka-examples
    
Test the installation with:

::
  
  cd valkka-examples
  python3 quicktest.py
  
  
and you're all set.

When updating the python examples (do this always after updating *valkka-core*), do the following:

::
  
  git pull
  python3 quicktest.py

This checks that **valkka-core** and **valkka-examples** have consistent versions.

In the case of a numerical python version mismatch error, you are not using the default numpy provided by your Ubuntu distribution (from the debian package *python3-numpy*).  Remove the conflicting numpy installation with *pip3 uninstall* or setting up a virtualenv.
  
Next, try out the :ref:`PyQt test/demo <testsuite>` suite or learn to program with the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`.


GTK
---

If you wan't to use `GTK <https://www.gtk.org/>`_ as your graphical user interface, you must install the PyGObject python bindings, as instructed `here <https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_, namely:

::

    sudo apt-get install python-gi python-gi-cairo python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0

.. Wx
.. --
..
.. In order to use the `wx graphical user interface <https://wxpython.org>`_, install it like this:
..
.. ::
..  
..    pip3 install --user wxpython
..
.. .. that does not compile
    
.. _install_opencv:
    
OpenCV
------
  
**Ubuntu 18**

Simply:

::

    sudo apt-get install python3-opencv

Remember that if you prefer to install with ```pip```, OpenCV's high-gui environment won't probably work for you.

Development version
-------------------

As described above, for the current stable version of *valkka-core*, just use the repository. 

For the development version (with experimental and unstable features) you have to compile from source.  Both *valkka-core* and *valkka-examples* must be in the development version.  You should also remove (with apt-get remove) the current stable version.

For building, some extra packages are needed:

::

  sudo apt-get install build-essential libc6-dev yasm cmake pkg-config swig libglew-dev mesa-common-dev libstdc++-5-dev python3-dev python3-numpy libasound2-dev

Getting and preparing the *valkka-core* development build (do this only once):

::

    git clone https://github.com/elsampsa/valkka-core
    git checkout dev
    ./prepare_build.bash
    
Updating and compiling the development build:
    
::

    git pull
    ./easy_build.bash
    
Before using the development build, run (sets your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH):

::

    ./use_build.bash
    
    
Now you have a terminal that has correct environmental variables.  Programs launched from the terminal will find the *valkka-core* development version.
    
For the *valkka-examples* testsuite, just do:

::

    git checkout dev
    
Updating the testsuite development version:

::

    git pull
    

Reverting testsuite back to the stable branch (for which you have debian packages from the repository):

::

    git checkout master
