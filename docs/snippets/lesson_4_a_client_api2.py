This is a *separate* python program for reading the frames that are written by Valkka to the shared memory.

The parameters used both in the server side (above) and on the client side (below) **must be exactly the same** and the client program should be started *after* the server program (and while the server is running).  Otherwise undefined behaviour will occur.  

The used shmem_name(s) should be same in both server and client, but different for another server/client pair.

The *client.shmem_list* is a list of numpy arrays, while *isize* defines the extent of data in the array.  This example simply prints out the first ten bytes of the RGB image.
